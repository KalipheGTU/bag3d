In the border tiles, there can be buildings among the AHN3 heights (blue) that have an AHN2 height (red) assigned to them. This is because the border tiles are 3dfied twice. Once with AHN2 and once with AHN3. Then the union of this output is computed, where footprints with NULL height are discarded from the AHN3 tile. Therefore footprints that have not point cloud in AHN3, because the building was not existing at the time of the survey, they get a NULL height. However, these footprints might have had a point cloud in AHN2, relating to an earlier building. Then these AHN2 footprints are added by the union. But these "incorrect" footprints are easily recognized, because the building was built after the date of the AHN survey.

For example in case of tiles 37hn1, 37hz1 in Rotterdam, about 96% of the buildings have a valid height (green). And we can see that AHN2 is still relevant for most of the buildings. (green_valid-height.png)
